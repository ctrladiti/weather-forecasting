# Weather Forecasting Dashboard

A real-time, interactive dashboard to visualize temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other forecast data for any city worldwide — powered by Open-Meteo API and built using Streamlit and Python.

---

## Overview

This project allows users to:

* Search any city and get **daily weather forecasts** for the next 1–7 days
* View **interactive plots** of average temperature, humidity, windspeed, and pressure
* Utilize free and open **weather API** data
* Explore a clean, dashboard-style UI built with **Streamlit**

---

## Features

- Input any global city (via geolocation lookup)
- Select number of forecast days (1 to 7)
- Daily aggregated temperature (avg, min, max)
- Real-time humidity, windspeed, and pressure plots
- Responsive dashboard layout with KPI-style info boxes
- Streamlit-powered frontend — deployable instantly
